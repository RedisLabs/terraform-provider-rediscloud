# Resource: rediscloud_active_active_subscription

Creates an Active-Active Subscription within your Redis Enterprise Cloud Account.
This resource is responsible for creating and managing subscriptions.

~> **Note:** The creation_plan block allows the API server to create a well-optimised infrastructure for your databases in the cluster.
The attributes inside the block are used by the provider to create initial 
databases. Those databases will be deleted after provisioning a new 
subscription, then the databases defined as separate resources will be attached to 
the subscription. The creation_plan block can ONLY be used for provisioning new 
subscriptions, the block will be ignored if you make any further changes or try importing the resource (e.g. `terraform import` ...).  

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "rediscloud_payment_method" "card" {
	card_type = "Visa"
}
  
resource "rediscloud_active_active_subscription" "subscription-resource" {
	name = "subscription-name"
	payment_method_id = data.rediscloud_payment_method.card.id
	cloud_provider = "AWS"
   
	creation_plan {
	  memory_limit_in_gb = 1
	  quantity = 1
	  region {
		  region = "us-east-1"
		  networking_deployment_cidr = "192.168.0.0/24"
		  write_operations_per_second = 1000
		  read_operations_per_second = 1000
	  }
	  region {
		  region = "us-east-2"
		  networking_deployment_cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"
		  write_operations_per_second = 1000
		  read_operations_per_second = 1000
	  }
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A meaningful name to identify the subscription
* `payment_method` (Optional) The payment method for the requested subscription, (either `credit-card` or `marketplace`). If `credit-card` is specified, `payment_method_id` must be defined. Default: 'credit-card'
* `payment_method_id` - (Optional) A valid payment method pre-defined in the current account. This value is __Optional__ for AWS/GCP Marketplace accounts, but __Required__ for all other account types 
* `cloud_provider` - (Optional) The cloud provider to use with the subscription, (either `AWS` or `GCP`). Default: ‘AWS’  
* `creation_plan` - (Required) A creation plan object, documented below

The `creation_plan` block supports:

* `memory_limit_in_gb` - (Required) Maximum memory usage that will be used for your largest planned database, including replication and other overhead
* `quantity` - (Required) The planned number of databases in the subscription.
* `support_oss_cluster_api` - (Optional) Support Redis open-source (OSS) Cluster API. Default: ‘false’

The creation_plan `region` block supports:

* `region` - (Required) Deployment region as defined by cloud provider
* `networking_deployment_cidr` - (Required) Deployment CIDR mask. The total number of bits must be 24 (x.x.x.x/24)
* `write_operations_per_second` - (Required) Throughput measurement for an active-active subscription
* `read_operations_per_second` - (Required) Throughput measurement for an active-active subscription

~> **Note:** If changes are made to attributes in the subscription which require the subscription to be recreated (such as `cloud_provider` or `payment_method`), the creation_plan will need to be defined in order to change these attributes. This is because the creation_plan is always required when a subscription is created.


### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 mins) Used when creating the subscription
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 mins) Used when updating the subscription
* `delete` - (Defaults to 10 mins) Used when destroying the subscription

## Import

`rediscloud_active_active_subscription` can be imported using the ID of the subscription, e.g.

```
$ terraform import rediscloud_active_active_subscription.subscription-resource 12345678
```

~> **Note:** the creation_plan block will be ignored during imports.
