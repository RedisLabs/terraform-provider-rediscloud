# Resource: rediscloud_active_active_subscription_database

This data source allows access to the details of an existing database within your Redis Enterprise Cloud account.

-> **Note:** This is for databases within Active-Active Subscriptions only. See also `rediscloud_database` (Pro) and `rediscloud_essentials_database`.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to locate a single database within an AA Subscription. This example assumes the subscription
only contains a single database.

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_active_active_subscription_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
}
```

The following example shows how to use the name to locate a single database within an AA subscription that has multiple
databases.

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_active_active_subscription_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
  name            = "first-database"
}
```
