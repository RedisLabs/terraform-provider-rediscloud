# Data Source: rediscloud_database

The Database data source allows access to the details of an existing database within your Redis Enterprise Cloud account.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to locate a single database within a Subscription.  This example assumes the subscription only contains a single database.

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
}
```

The following example shows how to use the name to locate a single database within a subscription that has multiple databases. 

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
  name = "first-database"
}
```
