# Data Source: rediscloud_database

This data source allows access to the details of an existing database within your Redis Enterprise Cloud account.

-> **Note:** This is for databases within Pro Subscriptions only. See also `rediscloud_active_active_subscription_database` and `rediscloud_essentials_database`.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how to locate a single database within a Subscription.  This example assumes the subscription only contains a single database.

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
}
```

The following example shows how to use the name to locate a single database within a subscription that has multiple databases.

```hcl-terraform
data "rediscloud_database" "example" {
  subscription_id = "1234"
  name = "first-database"
}
```


## Argument Reference

* `subscription_id` - (Required) ID of the subscription that the database belongs to
* `name` - (Optional) The name of the database to filter returned databases

* `protocol` - The protocol of the database.
* `memory_limit_in_gb` - The maximum memory usage for the database.
* `support_oss_cluster_api` - Supports the Redis open-source (OSS) Cluster API.
* `resp_version` - Either `resp2` or `resp3`. Database's RESP version.
* `replica_of` - The set of Redis database URIs, in the format `redis://user:password@host:port`, that this
  database will be a replica of.

* `data_persistence` - The rate of database data persistence (in persistent storage).
* `data_eviction` - The data items eviction policy.
* `password` - The password used to access the database - not present on `memcached` protocol databases.
* `replication` - Database replication.
* `throughput_measurement_by` - The throughput measurement method.
* `throughput_measurement_value` - The throughput value.
* `hashing_policy` - The list of regular expression rules the database is sharded by. See
  [the documentation on clustering](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rc/concepts/clustering/) for more information on the
  hashing policy.
* `public_endpoint` - Public endpoint to access the database
* `private_endpoint` - Private endpoint to access the database
* `enable_tls` - Enable TLS for database, default is `false`
* `enable_default_user` - When `true` enables connecting to the database with the default user. Default `true`.

* `latest_import_status` - A latest_import_status object, documented below.

The `alert` block supports:

* `name` - The alert name
* `value` - The alert value

The `latest_backup_status` and `latest_import_status` blocks contain:

* `error` - An error block, in case this lookup failed, documented below.
* `response` - A detail block, documented below.

The `error` block in both `latest_backup_status` and `latest_import_status` contains:

* `description` - A description of the error encountered while looking up the status of the last backup/import.
* `status` - Any particular HTTP status code associated with the erroneous status check.

The `response` block `latest_backup_status` contains:

* `status` - The status of the last backup operation.
* `last_backup_time` - When the last backup operation occurred.
* `failure_reason` - If a failure, why the backup operation failed.

The `response` block `latest_import_status` contains:

* `status` - The status of the last import operation.
* `last_import_time` - When the last import operation occurred.
* `failure_reason` - If a failure, why the import operation failed.
* `failure_reason_params` - Parameters of the failure, if appropriate, in the form of a list of objects each with a `key` entry and a `value` entry.
