## Argument Reference

In addition to [generic `provider` arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)
(e.g. `alias` and `version`), the following arguments are supported in the Redis Cloud
`provider` block:
 
* `url` - (Optional) This is the URL of Redis Cloud and will default to `https://api.redislabs.com/v1`.
This can also be set by the `REDISCLOUD_URL` environment variable. 

* `api_key` - (Optional) This is the Redis Cloud API key. It must be provided but can also be set by the
`REDISCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.

* `secret_key` - (Optional) This is the Redis Cloud API secret key. It must be provided but can also be set
by the `REDISCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
